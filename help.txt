Open a new 'screen' instance

$ screen
Once, in the screen, you can 'detach' (or close out of it) the screen like this:
ctrl+A and then press D

To resume a screen, you typically do this:
$ screen -x

If you have more than one screen instance, it will tell you their IDs, in which case you can choose which one to resume like this:
$ screen -r <screen id>
